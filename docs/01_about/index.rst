About Celbridge
---------------

- **File Explorer**
    - you work with your own files, on your own computer, privately and securely.

- **Python**
    - Celbridge allows you to speficy a Python version (and extensions) and uses UV to create a virtual machine to work within for your project.

- **Spreasdsheet Data**
    - Celbridge allows you to work with Microsoft Excel file formats, with a full visual spreadsheet front-end (curtesy of SpreadJS), so you can edit and format your spreadsheets in a natural always.

- **Spreadsheet validation**
    - a Python script can be set to run each time you make a change to a spreadsheet cell, automating spreadsheet validation/transformation.

- **Web Viewer**
    - you can view and interact with web pages and webapps through files ending with `.webapp`, where you specify a URL and the built-in webview of Celbridge presents the interactive webpage you specify in the file properties.
